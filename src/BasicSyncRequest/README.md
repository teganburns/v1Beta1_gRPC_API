This is still pretty messy and has no guarantee of working on your system!!

1) as stated in /README.md you will need gRPC and protobuf3. Make sure to read /README.md for full details!!

2) use make to compile

3) run the program with the specified audio file and configuration file as arguments. Ex. './main_cpp audio.flac CONFIG'

NOTE: If a non-existant config file is specified then it will make one for you and then prompt you to run the program again with the same args.
