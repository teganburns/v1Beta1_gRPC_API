**Project currently depreciated**

C++ implmentations using Google's Speech (v1Beta1) API. Checkout Google's [Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/speech/)

ALL projects  use  gRPC wich you can checkout at their [Main Website](http://www.grpc.io/) or the [Git Repo](https://github.com/grpc/grpc)

AudioSyncRequest and StreamingSyncRequest use SFML wich can be found here: [Main Website](http://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php) and [Git Repo](https://github.com/SFML/SFML)

[AudioSyncRequest](/AudioSyncRequest/):


This requires that you have SFML 2.4.0 installed (see http://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php for details)

### Notes:

I have another repo [VisualAudio](https://github.com/teganburns/Visual_Audio) that uses SFML to Graphicaly display the audio input. I plan to include in my final Speech API project along with 
StreamingRequest. Go check it out it's pretty neat!! :)
